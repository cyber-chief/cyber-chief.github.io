If you're new to security in general, you're in the right spot! While this blog may not have all the answers, I am putting up other resources of other security professionals who have helped me understand the 
ins and outs of the different topics.

The important thing to remember about the info sec community is that the community is very open. If you don't understand something someone somewhere has dealt with it. Don't be afraid to ask Google. There are countless blogs out there that have explained things in a way you may understand. With that being said, don't think that they will hold your hand through the process. Cyber security is hard and you will struggle.
