Hi Everyone! I am cyber-chief.
I wanted to make a post to provide some background about myself to put some credibility behind what I write on this site. <br /> 
I graduated from Penn State in 2019 with two Bachelor Degrees. One in cyber security and the other in software development.For the last 4 years, I have worked in IT and infosec. Currently I am Senior Security Engineer, developing and testing secure solutions for an Aerospace and Defense company. During my time out of school, I have become interested in all parts of security with a keen interest in AppSec/Pentesting. In that pursuit, I have obtained the Security+ and the OSCP. <br />
I hope to help you all learn a bit about infosec while I document some of the things I am learning.<br />
As always if you'd like to reach out and discuss infosec, feel free to email me using the link to the left.
